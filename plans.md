# Plans

As noted in the introducion, MiniLatex is still a research project,
albeit one that has already used to produces documents like these
[lecture notes](https://knode.io/424).

The main areas of work are as follows:

## MiniLatex

- Extend the scope of MiniLatex
- Expand the test suite to guarantee correctness and stability
- Test MiniLatex with users; use their feedback to extend the
  scope of MiniLatex.
- Document the code so that it will be maintainable by others
- Refactor the code for clarity and maintainability
- Write a user manual
- Verify and publish the formal grammar

## knode.io

[knode.io](https://knode.io) is a content management system
which uses MiniLatex

- User testing
- Operations manual
